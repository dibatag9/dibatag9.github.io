    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience is members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who are temple workers or patrons and
      their families</p>

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <h4>Heading Font: Montserrat</h4>
    <p>I chose this sans serif font because it works with Open Sans  well and suggests a friendly tone.</p>
    <h4>Paragraph Font: Open Sans</h4>
    <p>I chose this font because of it's readability. This sans-serif font works in paragraphs and it is also very friendly looking.</p>
    <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
    <p>We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to temple service and accomodations. Our
      shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe alternative
      for your family.</p>
    <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
    <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from
      traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and freshing up
      in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>
